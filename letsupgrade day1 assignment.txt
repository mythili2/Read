 1Q. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans- It is mixture of Disturbuted Database and cryptography.
          A blockchain is a digital record of transactions. The name comes from its structure, in 
          which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in single list, called a chain.
          Blockchains are used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and have many other applications.
          Each transaction added to a blockchain is validated by multiple computers on the Internet. 
          These systems, which are configured to monitor specific types of blockchain transactions, form a peer-to-peer network.  
2Q.    What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
Ans- ->  security
         ->authenticity
        ->Database security
        - >Transaction records.
 
Q 3. What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?
 Ans- ->Verifiable
          ->Unchangeable
          -> Tamper proof
          ->Immutable   
Q.4 What all things a block contains?
Ans- ->Block number
          ->Transaction records
          -> Previous block signature
          ->Mining key (Nonce)  
Q.5 How the verifiability of the blockchain has been attained?
Ans-Blockchain is divided into several multiple computer.
         Where blockchain or fingerprint of data is calculated
          by the SHA256(Secure Hash algorithm).There is group
          where involved each and every person.The database is
         provided by hash. If the hash of all the participants
          is the same, then the data is similar to one another. But if 
          the hash of one of the participants is different, then
         we can cross-check what was the difference of the data
        which was leading to a different data.
